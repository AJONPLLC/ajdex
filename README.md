# AJDex
Photos of AJ the cat.

This is a similar repo as [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). Although there is no intention for us to make a duplicate of the Octocat it is just a great example because we have a Black Cat and [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) is usually black and has cat like ears 😺

# Why AJDex
Well I am a developer but I pretend to be artistic with my stick figure attempts. I would love the community to be able to share their cool designs and come up with a nice logo for the site!

# AJ Requirements
## Looks
Must be cat like, and have a collar with AJ on it...yep thats it.
